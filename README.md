# Python-Group-Project
This project aims to develop database maintenance software for small businesses. Self-employed business entrepreneurs frequently struggle to come up with the cash needed for expenses such as inventory management, tax preparation, and bookkeeping. We want to develop a clear reporting tool that is simple to use and administer with the aid of this project.
