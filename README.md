# Inverntory and cost management application
This project aims to develop webapplication/software for small businesses. Self-employed business entrepreneurs frequently struggle to come up with the cash needed for expenses such as inventory management, tax preparation, and bookkeeping. We want to develop a clear reporting and managing software/system that is simple to use. Wemainly maintain two databases (DB) with distinct tables.
#### Products DB 
  This contains two tables.
    * Products: Contains product details and available quantities of each product
    * Unit price: Unit price details- Taking into account the VAT, import/export tax, shipping cost, purchase price, other expenses, etc., this will determine
#### Expenses DB
This contains four tables.
* phonebills : Company phone bill chrges on monthly basis
* capitalcost: Include all the cost that company spend on buying necessary items
* transportbills: Include local tranport cost
* Imported item cost : Include all the imported item cost information including shipping and custome duty charges


* ### How to use:
    * Download the content and open the folder with visual studio. 
    * Open app.py and run the python code.
    * Split the editor window and pressing ctrl+shift+p open the simple browser view.
    * Now you can select the functionality according to your requirements.
    * Both DBs are stored in db folder and you can visualize the data stored in the DBs using DBeaver  Attach/ upload an excel or csv file : inventory data in the proper format
    * If data is needed to stored in the DBs using a file, convert it into 'CSV' file format. This file need to copy to files folder.
    * 
    * 

* ### Backend:
    * Use flask to develop
    * Process data and provide necessary report
    * Reject if the file is not in correct format( with instruction)
    * Update database accordingly - remove after sales/ add after buy.??
    * Security??? 
    * authorization method to aceess database

 ## AIM 
 * Create a project based on Python/SQL 
 * Integration of backend/frontend development
 * Workflow through CI/CD (github action).
 * Maintain the project update in Github.
 
 
 ### Time frame and contributions: will be added.
